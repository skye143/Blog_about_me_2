                Skye is a newly enrolled student at Rutgers University's Full Stack Development Bootcamp, ready to
                embark on a new journey in her career. As a resident of New Jersey, Skye is excited to have the
                opportunity to attend a prestigious university in her home state. Having previously worked as an APTL at
                Target, Skye is no stranger to hard work and determination. However, she recognizes that transitioning
                to a career in coding will require a different set of skills and dedication. Skye has been teaching
                herself coding for the past year, and she is now ready to take her skills to the next level with the
                help of the bootcamp program.
                <br><br>
                Despite being a big change in careers, Skye is eager to learn and grow in the world of coding. She is
                excited about the endless possibilities that come with mastering full stack development and is confident
                that the bootcamp program will help her reach her goals. Skye knows that it will take a lot of hard work
                and dedication to become a successful developer, but she is determined to put in the effort to make her
                dreams a reality. With her positive attitude and drive to succeed, Skye is ready to take on any
                challenges that come her way as she starts her new journey at Rutgers University.
